  abstract = {Motivated by the design of fast reinforcement learning algorithms, we study the diffusive limit of a class of pure jump ergodic stochastic control problems. We show that, whenever the intensity of jumps is large enough, the approximation error is governed by the H{\"o}lder continuity of the Hessian matrix of the solution to the limit ergodic partial differential equation. This extends to this context the results of [1] obtained for finite horizon problems. We also explain how to construct a first order error correction term under appropriate smoothness assumptions. Finally, we quantify the error induced by the use of the Markov control policy constructed from the numerical finite difference scheme associated to the limit diffusive problem, this seems to be new in the literature and of its own interest. This approach permits to reduce very significantly the numerical resolution cost.},

  abstract = {We consider the diffusive limit of a typical pure-jump Markovian control problem as the intensity of the driving Poisson process tends to infinity. We show that the convergence speed is provided by the Hölder constant of the Hessian of the limit problem, and explain how correction terms can be constructed. This provides an alternative efficient method for the numerical approximation of the optimal control of a pure-jump problem in situations with very high intensity of jump. We illustrate this approach in the context of a display advertising auction problem.},

  abstract = 	 {In display advertising, a small group of sellers and bidders face each other in up to $10^{12}$ auctions a day. In this context, revenue maximisation via monopoly price learning is a high-value problem for sellers. By nature, these auctions are online and produce a very high frequency stream of data. This results in a computational strain that requires algorithms be real-time. Unfortunately, existing methods inherited from the batch setting suffer $O(\sqrt{t})$ time/memory complexity at each update, prohibiting their use. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm for online learning of monopoly prices in online auctions whose update is constant in time and memory.},

I have participated in a series of reading groups organised by the [FairPlay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/fairplay) Inria team at [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/) for some years now.

Over the years, we have read the following books:

- An Introduction to Queueing Theory: Modeling and Analysis in Applications, U. N. Bhat
- Introduction to Random Graphs, A. Frieze & M. Karonski
-  Computational Aspects of Cooperative Game Theory, G. Chalkiadakis, E. Elkind, & M. Wooldridge
- Online Nonstochastic Control, E. Hazan & K. Singh
- Lectures on BSDEs, Stochastic Control, and Stochastic Differential Games with Financial applications, R. Carmona
- Beyond the Worst-Case Analysis of Algorithms, T. Roughgarden Ed.

I have been the organiser of the reading group since July 2023, and have thus been in charge of the following books:
- An Introduction to Queueing Theory: Modeling and Analysis in Applications, U. N. Bhat
- Introduction to Random Graphs, A. Frieze & M. Karonski

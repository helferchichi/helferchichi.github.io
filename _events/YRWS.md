A 5-day retreat for Ph.D. students and Postdocs in the CEREMADE laboratory. The goal was to present our work to each other and foster collaboration in the context of the disruptions to the lab's social life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of a 3 person committee with Adechola Kouande and Katharina Eichinger, we handled the whole organisation, including finding and arranging accommodation and transportation, budgeting (quotes, funding, etc.), and the scientific program (speakers, schedule, activities, etc.).

The event was a great time and succeeded in cementing the social bonds between the Ph.D. students in the lab.

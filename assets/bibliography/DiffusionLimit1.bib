abstract = {We consider the diffusive limit of a typical pure-jump Markovian control problem as the intensity of the driving Poisson process tends to infinity. We show that the convergence speed is provided by the HÃ¶lder constant of the Hessian of the limit problem, and explain how correction terms can be constructed. This provides an alternative efficient method for the numerical approximation of the optimal control of a pure-jump problem in situations with very high intensity of jump. We illustrate this approach in the context of a display advertising auction problem.},
